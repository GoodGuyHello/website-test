Hello everyone, my name is Kenny Nguyen and I am currently majoring in Computing and Security Technology. My main focus is in Cybersecurity, so I have experience in digital forensics, network monitoring, and red teaming. I came to Drexel to strengthen my existing knowledge and take away what I can from peers, professors, and anyone alike.
