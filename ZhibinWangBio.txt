My name is Zhibin Wang, and I am a transfer student at Drexel University majoring in Computing & Security Technology. I have strong passions on network security and information technology. I am also interested in building and upgrading PCs, which has given me practical experience. I aim to apply my technical skills and my troubleshooting abilities to solve real-world IT problems in a future co-op role.
